      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I’m a student at BYU studying Cybersecurity and Economics. I’ve always been curious about how tech works behind the scenes — especially how to keep systems safe.</p>
      <p>Right now I’m taking IT&C 101 and MATH 112, which are helping me build the basics in both areas.</p>

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I’m really into tech, especially things like AI and internet security. I like digging into how different systems work and connect.</p>
      <p>On the side, I enjoy trying out small business ideas — mostly ones that mix tech and creativity.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Outside of school, I like hitting the gym early in the mornings. I’ve also been working on learning Spanish and getting better at cooking.</p>
      <p><em>Fun fact:</em> I’ve been practicing survival skills like fire-building and first aid just for fun.</p>
